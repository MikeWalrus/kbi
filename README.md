# How to compile `kbi`?

## Linux

Make sure you have portaudio and gtkmm-4.0 installed and open this project in any IDE that supports CMake.

## Windows

### 1. Install [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/)

### 2. Open msys2.exe

Run theses commands to install some packages.

```
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake mingw-w64-x86_64-extra-cmake-modules
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-make
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gdb
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-portaudio
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gtkmm4
```

### 3. Environment variable

Add `...\mingw64\bin` in your MSYS2 directory to the `path` environment variable.

### 4. Open CLion (I don't know the exact steps to configure other IDEs)

Set the toolchain to mingw if it is not the default toolchain.

### 5. Build and run

If it fails, comment out the line with something like `WIN32` in the header file where the error occurs.

## macOS

### 1. Install portaudio and gtkmm-4.0 using Homebrew

```shell
brew install portaudio gtkmm4
```

Also, please install `pkg-config` with Homebrew if you don't have it already

### 2. Check that directory `/usr/local/lib` is in [`CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH`](http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/v2.8.12/cmake.html#variable:CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH)

### 3. Build and run with cmake

## Cannot compile with `gcc` 11

This is caused by [some obsolete headers](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glibmm/-/merge_requests/50) in `glibmm`. You
can either go back to `gcc` 10 or modify some files.

To compile with gcc 11 before the updated version is released and without building `glibmm` from the repository:

1. find `variant.h` and `variant_basictypes.h` in your (possibly in mingw64 if you're on
   Windows) `/usr/include/glibmm-2.68/glibmm`.

2. Substitute all occurrence of `Variant<`(anything)`>()` with just `Variant()`.

   You can do this in vim with `:%s/Variant<.*>()/Variant()/g`.
