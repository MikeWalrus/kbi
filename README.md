## How to compile `kbi`?

### Linux

Make sure you have portaudio and gtkmm-4.0 installed and open this project in any IDE that supports CMake.

### Windows

#### 1. Install [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/)

#### 2. Open msys2.exe

Run theses commands to install some packages.

```
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake mingw-w64-x86_64-extra-cmake-modules
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-make
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gdb
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-portaudio
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gtkmm4
```

#### 3. Environment variable

Add `...\mingw64\bin` in your MSYS2 directory to the `path` environment variable.

#### 4. Open CLion (I don't know the exact steps to configure other IDEs)

Set the toolchain to mingw if it is not the default toolchain.

#### 5. Build and run

If it fails, comment out the line with something like `WIN32` in the header file where the error occurs.

### macOS

#### 1. Install portaudio and gtkmm-4.0 using Homebrew

```shell
brew install portaudio gtkmm4
```

Also, please install `pkg-config` with Homebrew if you don't have it already

### 2. Check that directory `/usr/local/lib` is in [`CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH`](http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/v2.8.12/cmake.html#variable:CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH)

#### 3. Build and run with cmake
